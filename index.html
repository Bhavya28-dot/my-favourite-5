        <p>My hobby is to draw and to do crafts.When I have free time, I relax myself by doing drawing, paintings and mini crafts. It the age of 7,I started to know about drawing beatiful picture.Now I draw beatiful pictures and everyone are proud of me. I too got few prizes in drawing competitions.I sometimes think there is nothing so delightful as drawing.The first writing of the human being was drawing, not writing.</p>

            <p>I love to design and code apps.Before 2 years, I didn't know what does code means and how to code.I thought it's all hard!But now, see me, I know very well to do code. I have have build more than 20 apps. In making app, designing is my favourite part,coloring the screen, decorating,etc.Coding is the language of the future, and every girl should learn it.Everybody should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you how to think.</p>

            <p> My inspiration for drawing is the famous artists in the world. I see many videos and paintings by which I get inspired. Creativity takes courage. Art enables us to find ourselves and lose ourselves at the same time.</p>
